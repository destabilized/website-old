      <description>&lt;p&gt;new years, same bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;2d-model-of-my-pcb&#34;&gt;2d model of my pcb&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/sw2/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this week was all about lightbox project, where i had lots of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an attiny85&amp;rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-reinforcement-aihttpsgithubcomsiwenceinqui&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/siwence/inqui&#34;&gt;deep reinforcement ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;2024-present&#34;&gt;2024-present&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;inspired by ai warehouse, i decided to try and create my own deep reinforcement learning ai from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;using an environment made using pybullet and gymnasium, i created a simple obstacle course where the ai has one objective: reaching the pressure plate. by using a dqn (deep q-network) it and a reward system, it&amp;rsquo;s movements will become seemingly random, before quickly adapting to reach the pressure plate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
