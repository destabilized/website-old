<h4 id="2024---early-2025">2024 - early 2025</h4>
<p>inspired by ai warehouse, i decided to try and create my own deep reinforcement learning ai from scratch.</p>
<p>using an environment made using pybullet and gymnasium, i created a simple obstacle course where the ai has one objective: reaching the pressure plate. by using a dqn (deep q-network) it and a reward system, it&rsquo;s movements will become seemingly random, before quickly adapting to reach the pressure plate.</p>
<p>through this project, i learned the basics of deep reinforcement ai learning, and dip my toes in <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">gymnasium</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/">numpy</a>, <a href="https://pybullet.org/wordpress/">pybullet</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a>.</p>
<p>finished a few days after the new years, just for the code and conda prompt to stop working.</p>
<h2 id="pokemeow-script"><a href="https://github.com/siwence/pokemeow-script">pokemeow script</a></h2>
<h4 id="2025">2025</h4>
<p>during the christmas break, i wanted to make some simple scripts to automate games.</p>
<p>i remembered a simple pokemon discord bot game, which i used to play a bunch of times during covid, so i decided to write a simple script to automate it.</p>
<p>using pyautogui to write the commands to spawn the pokemon, and pytesseract to determine which pokeball to use to catch the pokemon, it is able to be run with some supervision to automatically catch pokemon</p>
<p>in the future, i may train a yolo model and allow the script to solve captcha images which the pokemeow bot provides if it detects that you may potentially be botting, making the script fully autonomous.</p>
<h2 id="lightbox-project"><a href="https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/categories/lightbox/">lightbox project</a></h2>
<h4 id="2025-1">2025</h4>
<p>the lightbox project is a hands-on engineering project that is required for sophomore students where they will design and build a lightbox from scratch. in this project, students will incorperate a housing for a box, and some sort of sensor mechanism to illuminate a custom acrylic piece.</p>
<p>for my the housing of my lightbox, i decided to use a model of the mac mini, using a 0.75 scale and eventually 3d printed it.</p>
<p>for the sensor, i decided to use a temperature sensor, which would change the color of the acrylic depending on the temperature. this wasn&rsquo;t the best idea, as the temperature sensor was inside my housing, and would rarely change temperatures</p>
<p>for my acrylic piece, i found a derpy version of froakie, and ended up using that as my acyrlic piece.</p>
<h2 id="sumobot-project">sumobot project</h2>
<h4 id="2025---052025">2025 - 05/2025</h4>
<p>another hands-on engineering project that&rsquo;s a competition in pairs of two. i partnered with <a href="https://jonaswirz.wordpress.com/">jonas</a> and <a href="https://www.mileshilliard.com/">miles</a>. jonas worked on the cad, while i worked on the hardware. miles would solder and help test the sumobot.</p>
<p>we had a few restrictions on the sumobot, such as weight and size like normal sumobot competitions. in the end, we had a tournament style with the sumobot to determine who had the best bot.</p>
<p>while many bots used infrared sensors and a distance sensor, we decided to take a different approach and make ours fully mechanical, using roller lever switches to deteremine when the bot is on / off the arena.</p>
<p>in the end, the bot got 2nd place, barely losing 4-2 in a bo7 match against the winners.</p>
<p>(image soon when finished?)</p>
