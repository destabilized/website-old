            <description>&lt;p&gt;we weren’t required to write a blog post before break, so i’m including all the updates from that week here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@optimumtech&#34;&gt;optimum&lt;/a&gt; youtube videos, where he creates a custom mod for the viper v2 pro mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i decided to try something similar with the targus amu660, taking its internals and designing a &amp;ldquo;zerømouse&amp;rdquo;-inspired shell for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3d-model-of-pcb&#34;&gt;3d model of pcb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i began by creating a basic 3d model of the pcb to serve as the foundation for the shell and other components. in the image below, i’ve only modeled the left and right mouse buttons, along with the parts needed for the scroll wheel.

this is the initial shell design, modeled after the zerømouse. i still need to add the &ldquo;wings&rdquo; to the shell, as there’s currently no place to rest your fingers comfortably.</p>

<p>umm&hellip; i blame the 3d printer.
<img src="/img/soph/7/3d.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>this was just a test print, so it’s not a huge deal, but there were some issues.</p>
<p>i printed this on the fusion3, and for some reason, it randomly filled in one side where it wasn’t supposed to.</p>
<p>additionally, i noticed that the sensor area only had one layer, which i’ll need to fix by adjusting the shell thickness. i think that’s the reason behind the problem.</p>
<p>the stands for the pcb mounting holes are also misaligned. this is mostly because i’m not great at using calipers for precise measurements. i’ll need to tweak the hole sizes and reduce the diameter of the cylinders, as they don’t fit into the pcb holes properly.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;i broke another computer. that makes it the fourth thing i’ve broken this year as a sophomore&amp;hellip; at least i managed to complete my lightbox this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of my time was spent 3d printing the enclosure and laser cutting the acrylic piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;acrylic-piece&#34;&gt;acrylic piece&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while the box parts were printing, i continued working on the acrylic design and did a test cut on cardboard to check the fit.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/6/card.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the initial piece was slightly longer than i wanted, so i scaled it down to make it more compact. the adjusted size looked much better.

<h4 id="acrylic-piece">acrylic piece</h4>
<p>while the box parts were printing, i continued working on the acrylic design and did a test cut on cardboard to check the fit.

<h4 id="main-component">main component</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/main.jpeg" alt="website">
before the weekend, i started the 3d print for the main housing of my box and when we returned, it turned out amazing, unlike a few other components.</p>
<h4 id="lid">lid</h4>
<p>umm&hellip; i had a few errors with this&hellip;
<img src="/img/soph/6/lid1.jpeg" alt="website">
my first attempt at printing the lid was on the neptune, but it ended up warping. after discussing with others, i learned that many people faced similar issues with warping on that printer. to fix this, i decided to reprint it on the fusion3.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/lid2.jpeg" alt="website">
the second try turned into spaghetti, likely because i didn’t use enough adhesive. this forced me to print the lid a third time&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/lid3.jpeg" alt="website">
finally, after applying too much glue, the lid printed perfectly without any warping or other issues. with this done, only one piece remained before i could assemble the box.</p>
<h4 id="finished-product">finished product</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/full.jpeg" alt="website">
with all three prints completed and the acrylic piece finished (cut on the small laser cutter since the larger one was broken), my lightbox is finally done. the temperature sensor isn’t very practical since it’s enclosed, limiting airflow and temperature changes, but it still functions somewhat. the lid fit wasn’t perfect—it required a bit of force to secure—but it eventually worked, and everything came together nicely. moving forward, i have a few vague ideas for projects that i may tackle before we start the sumobot.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;i should be able to finish my lightbox by next week. just a few more tasks left to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;schematic-of-the-board&#34;&gt;schematic of the board&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/5/schem.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h4 id="schematic-of-the-board">schematic of the board</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/schem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.</p>
<h4 id="pcb-errors">pcb errors</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/error_1.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>the image above shows my pcb with several errors. the primary issue was that the traces were too thick, leaving insufficient clearance between components. although i could have enlarged the pcb to resolve these problems, i preferred the compact design and opted to reduce the trace width to 35mils instead of 50mils.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/error_2.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>after addressing those errors, five new ones appeared. these were caused by using the wrong components, as i hadn’t properly managed my electronic library (as mentioned earlier). once i fixed this, all errors were resolved, and the pcb was ready for milling.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/no_errors.png" alt="website"></p>
<h4 id="3d-pcb">3d pcb.</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/3dpcb.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>once the pcb was milled, most of my time was spent crimping the power and ground wires and replacing the neopixel with a lightstrip. i also designed a power mechanism to supply energy to the board. unfortunately, there were no aux connectors available, so adding an aux power option wasn’t possible.</p>
<h4 id="finished-product-pcb">finished product (pcb)</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/finished.jpg" alt="website"></p>
<p>after milling my pcb, i spent most of my time crimping the power and ground wires together, while also swapping the neopixel to a lightstrip. following this, i created a power mechanism in order to power up my board. sadly, there were no aux connectors, so making an aux connector to power my board wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible.</p>
<h4 id="acrylic-piece">acrylic piece</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/piece.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with the pcb complete, the final steps are to 3d print the box and finish the acrylic piece. i’ll start printing the box soon, as i can work on the acrylic piece simultaneously. by the end of next week, everything should be ready for assembly.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;slightly shorter week due to mlk day, so i focused more on double checking everything rather than starting something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design-completed&#34;&gt;box design (completed?)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i first created the lid for my box, which utilizes friction-fit, eliminating the need to use screws to keep the aesthetics clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/4/lid.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;additionally, i designed a separate compartment to house my neopixel. i previously had the component connected with my lid, but that would lead to overhang when printing. by creating it as a new component, i will have to print them separately, and combine them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>additionally, i designed a separate compartment to house my neopixel. i previously had the component connected with my lid, but that would lead to overhang when printing. by creating it as a new component, i will have to print them separately, and combine them together.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/4/np.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>in order to connect the two parts, i plan to use glue. overall, the box looks pretty clean, with no screws and an easy way to fix the box if error&rsquo;s were to occur.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/4/both.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>i believe that at this point, i&rsquo;m done with my lightbox. i will have to check wil mr.l about any potential errors before trying to print out the box. once confirmed, i will move onto creating my acrylic design, which will most likely feature a derpy pokemon design.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/4/full.png" alt="website"> <img src="/img/soph/4/diff_view.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>while finishing the box, a problem occured when making the lid, as the male headers on my pcb were too long and entering in the housing for the neopixel. to counteract this, i decided to scale my design by 0.75 instead of 0.5, leading to a slightly larger box. i&rsquo;m pretty happy with how the model is turning out, as cad isn&rsquo;t my strong suit. there are some things that i don&rsquo;t like, such as having a massive hole for power and not having the fan&rsquo;s on the bottom of the mac mini, as i&rsquo;m not sure how to make it, and not sure if it&rsquo;s possible to print it. to deal with the massive hole, me and my friend miles have discussed potentially using an auxiliary cable for power to make the design more realistic, and remove that massive hole for power.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;finally figured out how all the bugs work, and fixed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another week of the lightbox project, where i spent monday finalizing my code, before working purely on my box design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design&#34;&gt;box design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started this week by restarting my entire box, as i previously didn&amp;rsquo;t have my box cenetered around the origin, and i was building it on the wrong axis. additionally, the dimensions were all messed up, as i was using a wrong scale. upon fixing all my mistakes, i started adding in all of the different type of connection ports on the mac mini. these ports won&amp;rsquo;t have any functionality besides one, which will be used for powering the lightbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h4 id="box-design">box design</h4>
<p>i started this week by restarting my entire box, as i previously didn&rsquo;t have my box cenetered around the origin, and i was building it on the wrong axis. additionally, the dimensions were all messed up, as i was using a wrong scale. upon fixing all my mistakes, i started adding in all of the different type of connection ports on the mac mini. these ports won&rsquo;t have any functionality besides one, which will be used for powering the lightbox.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/3/3d.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>after finishing, i decided to consult my friend jonas for some help with creating standoffs, which will be used to mount my pcb on my box.</p>
<p>on my previous blog posts, i mentioned how i wanted to somehow make the acrylic design as a face of the box. however, there would be lots of problems revolving around orienting the neopixel in the way where it could stay secure, and still be able directly below the acrylic piece. therefore, unless i find a new solution, i will be moving forward from this idea, and use the top face to hold my acrylic piece.</p>
<h4 id="code--bug-fixes">code + bug fixes</h4>
<p>i decided to finally take a close look into my code to figure out some of my bugs, and i found them
<img src="/img/soph/3/code.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>previously, i stated how my temperature sensor was floating, yet worked one time upon changing the led_pin to 10.</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t the problem, but rather me messing things up.</p>
<p>i accidently swapped onewire with the led_pin, causing my neopixel to be connected to my onewire, and my led_pin to be connected to my temperature sensor.</p>
<p>how did the code temporarily work despite them being swapped? no clue.</p>
<p>but eventually, i got it fixed, and was able to troubleshoot my code properly, which ended up working as i expected.</p>
<p>the second bug i fixed was the bug with attiny&rsquo;s randomly not responding.</p>
<p>the problem this time was that since the attiny doesn&rsquo;t have serial support, and software serial wasn&rsquo;t working for me, i kept relying on the metro mini to use the serial, to debug my code. in doing so, i probably ended up corrupting the bootloader of the attiny84&rsquo;s, which caused them to not respond. thankfully, this was an easy, but tedious fix, as i would have to swap both the metro mini and the attiny. fortunately, no permanent was done to either the attiny84, or the metro mini (assuming you don&rsquo;t use both of them together), so they will be able to be reused for future projects.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;new years, same bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2d-model-of-my-pcb&#34;&gt;2d model of my pcb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/2/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h4 id="2d-model-of-my-pcb">2d model of my pcb</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/2/pcb.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design</p>
<h4 id="schematic-of-the-board">schematic of the board</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/2/schem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with the board design, unless i decide to make new improvements, i&rsquo;m ready to pcb mill upon finishing my lightbox.</p>
<h4 id="box-design">box design</h4>
<p>i decided to try and 3d print my box, using the acrylic piece as a face of my box. originally, i was going to try and make it as compact as possible, but i found more interest trying to 3d model a mac mini design by scratch, and replace the top apple logo with my acrylic piece.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/2/3d_model.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>the box still has lots of work to be done, as i want to try and incorporate all the features of the mac mini, including usb ports, ethernet port, and the bottom fan part. throughout the process of creating this box, i spent time talking with mr.l about overhang, and how to counteract any problems with it.</p>
<h4 id="code-bugs">code bugs</h4>
<p>like last year, the bugs persist.
<img src="/img/soph/2/code.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>like last post, the negative number (-196) shows that the temperature sensor is still floating. it was working the previous days of the week, until when i had to finish up the software of my program. the previous problem was due to my &ldquo;led_pin&rdquo; being set at 9, as even though it was wired up correctly, it caused an issue somehow which lead to the temperature sensor continuously printing -196.</p>
<p>besides that bug, i finalized the code for the lightbox (assuming this works). i decided to use a switch statement which changes the severity of a blue color depending on the temperature in the room, mapped with a range (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80+)</p>
<p>however, more bugs continue, with the attiny84 randomly deciding to not respond, leading to me having to swap out the metro-mini that i&rsquo;m using as the master.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;this week was all about lightbox project, where i had lots of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an attiny85&amp;rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>using the attiny84 was just as frustrating, as the microcontroller stopped working randomly many times, setting me back quite a bit of time</p>
<p>in the end, i got a simple temperature sensor to partially work with my lightbox. (the 18b20 temp sensor im using is having connection issues, which leads to the code running half the time) which will be depicting the color of my box.</p>
