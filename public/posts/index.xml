            <description>&lt;p&gt;new years, same bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2d-model-of-my-pcb&#34;&gt;2d model of my pcb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/sw2/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.</p>
<p>i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.</p>
<h4 id="2d-model-of-my-pcb">2d model of my pcb</h4>

<p>shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design</p>
<h4 id="schematic-of-the-board">schematic of the board</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/sw2/schem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with the board design, unless i decide to make new improvements, i&rsquo;m ready to pcb mill upon finishing my lightbox.</p>
<h4 id="box-design">box design</h4>
<p>i decided to try and 3d print my box, using the acrylic piece as a face of my box. originally, i was going to try and make it as compact as possible, but i found more interest trying to 3d model a mac mini design by scratch, and replace the top apple logo with my acrylic piece.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/sw2/3d_model.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>the box still has lots of work to be done, as i want to try and incorporate all the features of the mac mini, including usb ports, ethernet port, and the bottom fan part. throughout the process of creating this box, i spent time talking with mr.l about overhang, and how to counteract any problems with it.</p>
<h4 id="code-bugs">code bugs</h4>
<p>like last year, the bugs persist.
<img src="/img/soph/sw2/code.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>like last post, the negative number (-196) shows that the temperature sensor is still floating. it was working the previous days of the week, until when i had to finish up the software of my program. the previous problem was due to my &ldquo;led_pin&rdquo; being set at 9, as even though it was wired up correctly, it caused an issue somehow which lead to the temperature sensor continuously printing -196.</p>
<p>besides that bug, i finalized the code for the lightbox (assuming this works). i decided to use a switch statement which changes the severity of a blue color depending on the temperature in the room, mapped with a range (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80+)</p>
<p>however, more bugs continue, with the attiny84 randomly deciding to not respond, leading to me having to swap out the metro-mini that i&rsquo;m using as the master.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;this week was all about lightbox project, where i had lots of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an attiny85&amp;rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>using the attiny84 was just as frustrating, as the microcontroller stopped working randomly many times, setting me back quite a bit of time</p>
<p>in the end, i got a simple temperature sensor to partially work with my lightbox. (the 18b20 temp sensor im using is having connection issues, which leads to the code running half the time) which will be depicting the color of my box.</p>
