            <description>&lt;p&gt;got most of my things transfered from my previous linux installation into mint so i could finally start working on things again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have an idea of what i want to do junior and senior year, so i wanted to finish the zeromouse soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;errors occured though, and with the limited time due to eventual half days, finals, and other tests, this week was slightly shorter for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trigger&#34;&gt;trigger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, as you can recall from my blog post, the dimensions were a bit off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>i have an idea of what i want to do junior and senior year, so i wanted to finish the zeromouse soon.</p>
<p>errors occured though, and with the limited time due to eventual half days, finals, and other tests, this week was slightly shorter for me.</p>
<h3 id="trigger">trigger</h3>
<p>so, as you can recall from my blog post, the dimensions were a bit off.</p>
<p>to fix this, i decided to shorten the length of the trigger, while increasing the pushy thing(?) length so that it could properly press the button</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/18/left_odl.PNG" alt="website"></p>
<p>fixing this issue fixed my problem, and i decided to try a new mechanism to attach the pcb to the stands.</p>
<p>first, i wanted to test the print to make sure that my idea could be printed without supports.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/18/broken.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>while printing, someone told me that my print for some reason got evicted off of the build plate, and stopped printing halfway.</p>
<p>so, some friends suggested that i use brim, and after some supervision, it turned out quite well.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 90%;" src="/img/soph/18/new1.jpeg">
  <img style="width: 55%;" src="/img/soph/18/new2.jpeg">
</div>
<h4 id="innovation">innovation?</h4>
<p>rather than making a massive shell, i wanted to try a new approach and extend the bottom of the triggers to try and avoid making a huge shell.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/18/idea.jpg" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="this-is-from-optimums-new-zeromouse-blade-i-kinda-wanna-do-something-like-this">this is from optimum&rsquo;s new zeromouse blade, i kinda wanna do something like this</h6>
<p>however, i will still have to create some sort of base for the sensor (as this is a cheap mouse).</p>
<p>in the end, the mouse looked like this:
<img src="/img/soph/18/LEFT.PNG" alt="website"></p>
<p>however, printing this will be a problem, as there will be overhang that i probably cannot avoid.</p>
<p>now that the left trigger was done, a simple mirror would allow me to finish the right trigger right?</p>
<p>well, the pcb is weird, and the hole on each side is different, so i had to edit the bottom part of the right side a bit.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 90%;" src="/img/soph/18/right_problems.PNG">
  <img style="width: 55%;" src="/img/soph/18/fixed_right.PNG">
</div>
<p>now that my triggers are done, i can start extending and making the &ldquo;shell&rdquo; for the mouse. additionally, i still need to figure out a minimalistic way to add the sensor holder and a way to print the mouse.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;we were given an extra week to work on the sumobot, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to continue working on our sumobot seeing that we already did decently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as a result, i decided to revisit my zeromouse project as i want to finish it before the end of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seniors leaving, so i had to transfer everything to an actual computer. currently trying to install linux mint with lots of problems lol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>seniors leaving, so i had to transfer everything to an actual computer. currently trying to install linux mint with lots of problems lol.</p>
<h3 id="trigger-updates">trigger updates</h3>
<p>if you recall from my previous blog post, the left side of my triggers were pretty messed up as both sides had different geometries.</p>
<p>i tried using a sweep to redo this design, but i figured out that you can&rsquo;t sweep with two rails.</p>
<p>so i asked help from <a href="https://timmy.greenlifestylelabs.com/">tim</a> who suggested that i should loft part of it, then extrude the rest of the sides outwards to get the same size and geometry.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/left_trigger_left.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="left-side-of-mouse-trigger">left side of mouse trigger</h6>
<p>this ended up working perfectly, and fixed the problems with my mouse trigger that i had previously.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/left_trigger_right.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="right-side-of-mouse-trigger">right side of mouse trigger</h6>
<p>in the end, my triggers were almost a one-to-one copy of the original that i took <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/979182-lightweight-zeromouse-inspired-logitech-mx-mouse-m">linked here</a> from this model</p>
<p>after fixing the general shape, i had to create the &ldquo;stand&rdquo; for the mouse to mount onto the shell.
<img src="/img/soph/17/stand.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>had some problems with this one as well, but thanks to tim again, i got the stand to work. this may be adjusted slightly to fit my shell design, but it&rsquo;s looking promising so far.</p>
<h4 id="clicking-mechanism--problems">clicking mechanism + problems</h4>
<p>the final thing i had to do before testing out the print was making a clicking mechanism. had some problems creating the ramp and the clicker? (what do i call this) as it was a curved surface, so i wasn&rsquo;t able to directly make a sketch and extrude outwards.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/pressing.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with all of this done, i can now mirror it to create the right trigger when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>a problem was present however.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/problem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>as seen in the image, the scroll wheel stand was too tall for the trigger so i&rsquo;ll have to adjust the clicking thingy&rsquo;s length and the length of the stand so that the trigger doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. additionally, i may have to move the position of the clicker further upwards so the scroll wheel isn&rsquo;t in a weird place again.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;blog post not required, but i did so much this week that i don&amp;rsquo;t want to merge another week of work into this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sumobot competition in four more school days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;massive-code-changes&#34;&gt;massive code changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wanted to further simplify my code, even though it was already pretty simplified. also added a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;directional-movements&#34;&gt;directional movements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;previously, my code looked like this.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/8/directions.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while there is nothing wrong with this, it was quite cluttered with all the digitalwrites, so i decided to simplify it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>sumobot competition in four more school days.</p>
<h3 id="massive-code-changes">massive code changes</h3>
<p>wanted to further simplify my code, even though it was already pretty simplified. also added a few things.</p>
<h4 id="directional-movements">directional movements</h4>
<p>previously, my code looked like this.
<img src="/img/soph/8/directions.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>while there is nothing wrong with this, it was quite cluttered with all the digitalwrites, so i decided to simplify it.</p>
<p>using a function to control the motors, i was able to set a value (high or low) to each motor without having to continuously write &ldquo;digitalwrite(motor____, high/low).</p>
<p>in the end, my directional movement code ended up looking like this while utilizing a few functions:</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 90%;" src="/img/soph/16/motor_code.png">
  <img style="width: 55%;" src="/img/soph/16/directions_code.png">
</div>
<h6 id="huge-difference-compared-to-original-code-left-side-is-the-function-right-side-is-passing-the-values-to-the-function-for-each-direction">huge difference compared to original code. left side is the function, right side is passing the values to the function for each direction.</h6>
<p>in addition, i got rid of my old star function and &ldquo;startR&rdquo; function as the right button for some reason didn&rsquo;t work. (probably cause i wired it wrong on my pcb).</p>
<h4 id="button-changes">button changes</h4>
<p>since the right button was always &ldquo;on&rdquo; for some reason, i decided that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary, and just removed it. also, since my code for the buttons was all over the place, i decided to consolidate it into a single function.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/16/button_handling.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="keeping-the-same-idea-and-attack-pattern-of-the-button-but-consolidated">keeping the same idea and attack pattern of the button, but consolidated.</h6>
<h4 id="sensor-changes">sensor changes</h4>
<p>with my old code, when the sensors got activated, the motors moved backwards for a set amount of time. however, it sometimes wouldn&rsquo;t be enough time, and would end up moving forward too early / turning too early.</p>
<p>to fix this, we used a while loop and waited an extra second before starting the turn. in addition, more functions were created to further neaten up the code.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/original_sen.png">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/final_sen_code.png">
</div>
<h6 id="another-comparison-left-is-previous-code-right-side-is-my-updated-code">another comparison. left is previous code, right side is my updated code</h6>
<p>with all of these coding changes, my setup and loop was simplified drastically, now looking like this:
<img src="/img/soph/16/setup+loop.png" alt="website"></p>
<h3 id="testing-shenanigans">testing shenanigans</h3>
<p>we finally decided to get our sumobot assembled and i could finally test my code just to find some problems while testing. we encountered quite a bit of problems that we had to fix.</p>
<p>however, if anyone saw my pcb schematic that i made for the sumobot, you may have noticed that i don&rsquo;t have a common ground.</p>
<h4 id="pcb-problem">pcb problem</h4>
<p>well, we all didn&rsquo;t notice this until we started to test the sumobot where we saw that the sumobot only got power when the lever roller switches weren&rsquo;t pressed down for some reason. despite this, it worked to some degree for some reason (probably using a digital pin on the metromini as ground?)</p>
<p>after some re-looking on the pcb document, we noticed this problem. however, rather than re-milling a pcb, we decided to just make a new trace for ground.
<img src="/img/soph/16/fixed_ground.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>with this fixed, we were able to get testing.</p>
<h4 id="minor-setback">minor setback</h4>
<p>one of the main issues that we wanted to address was the lack of turning by the sumobot. while this was a quick fix of changing the delays to allow the backwards(); function to further back up, i accidentally broke one of the two sumobots.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/broken.jpeg">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/broken2.jpeg">
</div>
<p>for some reason, i just forgot to react or protect the bot in case it fell of the table, and it ended up falling off the table.</p>
<p>while this was easily fixed by reprinting the base and re-cutting the acrylic piece, it was a minor setback, and i started testing code on the second sumobot that miles made.</p>
<h4 id="testing-problems-cont">testing problems cont.</h4>
<p>problem no3.</p>
<p>right away, we noticed that one of the major problems was that the robot when crossing the white line (as the lever rollers can&rsquo;t detect color but rather when it isn&rsquo;t pressed), it was unable to bring itself back up.</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/vids/soph/16/problem.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>me and miles spent quite a while debugging possible fixes to this problem, some of which included:
- increasing the amount of times moving backwards off the edge
- implementing a &ldquo;bunnyhop&rdquo; mechanism where it &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, detaching the switches from the edge.
- adding a ramp to the sensors so it wouldn&rsquo;t get caught on the edge.</p>
<p>while the first two mechanisms didn&rsquo;t work, miles eventually noticed that due to the &ldquo;90°&rdquo; angle with the rollers, it wouldn&rsquo;t get back up as it was stuck in a perpendicular angle from the edge and the roller. to fix this, he suggested making a ramp to put onto the sensors to prevent it from getting jammed.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/16/improv.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="cardboard-ramps-to-prevent-jamming-on-the-edge">cardboard ramps to prevent jamming on the edge</h6>
<p>we decided to just use cardboard for a quick fix. combined with some hot glue, this ended up working amazingly.</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/vids/soph/16/fixed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>finally, we wanted to not have a set amount of turning delay, as it led to predictable movements and the sumobot staying on one side of the arena.</p>
<h4 id="turning-fixes--problems">turning fixes + problems</h4>
<p>originally, i was going to use a random function to generate a random number for the delay value, something like this:
<img src="/img/soph/16/turning_idea.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>however, while setting this up in the sumobot i realized that every time the sumobot was run, the same values were showing up.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/16/turning_problems.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="startl-indicates-that-it-has-been-rerun-and-you-can-see-that-the-same-values-show-up">startL indicates that it has been rerun, and you can see that the same values show up.</h6>
<p>this was because i had the seed where the random numbers would come from in the setup, where it would only change if it was re-uploaded. to fix this, i moved it to when the button gets pressed, which led to randomness every time like i wanted.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">  
  <img style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" src="/img/soph/16/turning_fix.png">
  <video style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" controls>
    <source src="/vids/soph/16/turning.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>
<h6 id="random-numbers-this-time-also-used-5-16--100-cause-there-wasnt-much-difference-between-like-600-and-620">random numbers this time. also used (5-16) * 100 cause there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between like 600 and 620</h6>
<p>with all of this, i believe our sumobot is done. potentially gotta fix the problems where it gets stuck for a bit (if possible), but that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<h3 id="sumobot-results">sumobot results</h3>
<p>the orange bot (the one that miles claimed) got second, losing to <a href="https://timmy.greenlifestylelabs.com/">tims</a> and <a href="https://benjismit.wordpress.com/">benji</a> with their extremely fast, suicide bot.</p>
<p>while we are given an extra week to revamp and improve our bots (as a few didn&rsquo;t work as intended), we likely won&rsquo;t be continuing our bot, marking the end of this project&hellip;unless?</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;had to restart because of an error i made a while ago that i should&amp;rsquo;ve noticed and addressed earlier&amp;hellip;. whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slow week because of ap tests, health, and a half day from monday - wednesday, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;restarting-so-fun&#34;&gt;restarting! (so fun!)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so. i never decided to test my shells with the scroll wheel for some reason, but i eventually decided to, just to realize that i made a major mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>had to restart because of an error i made a while ago that i should&rsquo;ve noticed and addressed earlier&hellip;. whoops.</p>
<p>slow week because of ap tests, health, and a half day from monday - wednesday, but whatever.</p>
<h4 id="restarting-so-fun">restarting! (so fun!)</h4>
<p>so. i never decided to test my shells with the scroll wheel for some reason, but i eventually decided to, just to realize that i made a major mistake.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/15/error.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>as seen in the image above, the scroll wheel rests around the center of the mouse, not near the front where i intended. this is because due to the mouse triggers i was using, i had to move the pcb location a bit back to be able to click the button, but as a result, the scroll wheel moved back a lot.</p>
<p>as a result, i&rsquo;m going to have to change up the design of the mouse buttons, ultimately causing me to change my frame as well.</p>
<h4 id="pcb-stuff">pcb stuff</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.mileshilliard.com/">miles</a> decided to fix my pcb thankfully, and now it works again</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/15/pcb-back.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>some of the wires did have to be solder somewhere else as i burnt the traces, and superglue was used to hold the wires together.</p>
<p>with this updated fix, despite having a faulty shell, i was able to test some other concerns i had</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/vids/soph/15/mouse.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h6 id="video-showcasing-the-working-pcb">video showcasing the working pcb</h6>
<p>as shown in the video, the problem a addressed a month ago(?) was in fact a problem here. the stands for the pcb were slightly too tall to the point where the led was unable to hit the sensor block. to counteract this, on my next model i will have to decrease the length of the stands.</p>
<p>additionally, i tested the mouse buttons on the pcb to ensure that everything else was working correctly. additionally, i put the sensor block and pcb into the original shell to make sure the sensor was in fact working, and it was the stand height that was the problem.</p>
<h4 id="triggers">triggers</h4>
<p>since i have to restart my shell and my mouse triggers, i decided that it would be better to design around the mouse triggers using a different design that hopefully wouldn&rsquo;t push my pcb back so far.</p>
<p>since the <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/979182-lightweight-zeromouse-inspired-logitech-mx-mouse-m">model</a> i was using had the mechanism for pushing the buttons so far back, i figured i&rsquo;d have to create my own trigger while somehow keeping the geometry of the original as close as possible.</p>
<p>i did have some problems copying the shape, especially on the sides as they were both different.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/15/mouseL-left.PNG">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/15/mouseL-right.PNG">
</div>
<p>left side looks really weird, so i&rsquo;m gonna have to fix that side and somehow adjust the mechanism for clicking the button to be closer to the front of the trigger.</p>

<p>fixed the length miscalculation (eyeballed ~2mm {which is still too small}) from last print (though forgot to implement before printing). also modified the angle to reduce overhang, which slightly decreased the button surface area.</p>
<p>had to relocate the stands to accommodate these changes - hopefully this doesn&rsquo;t cause issues later.</p>

attempted to resolder the pcb for sensor testing with poor results:
<pre><code>- difficulty attaching wires to small holes

- solder refused to adhere to wire insulation

- burned both the pcb and wire insulation

- final result non-functional
</code></pre>
<p>thankfully my friend <a href="https://www.mileshilliard.com/">miles</a> offered to help with resoldering. hoping the pcb isn&rsquo;t permanently damaged. (thank you so much)</p>
<h4 id="errors-to-fix">errors to fix?</h4>
<p>in order to add the stands to stabilize the pcb, i had to increase the length of the original stands a lot, resulting in the led potentially being too high and not hitting the sensor block</p>
<p>this is gonna be something i have to check over when i get a working usb wire (hopefully my board still works) which may take a bit</p>
<p>additionally i&rsquo;m hoping that the mouse triggers and shell with the stands are able to print without any blemishes or major imperfections.</p>
<p>besides putting it all together and testing, i&rsquo;m slowly creeping closer to finishing this project.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;short post since i won&amp;rsquo;t be here tomorrow. made good progress this week though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wings&#34;&gt;wings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally added the &amp;ldquo;wings&amp;rdquo; i mentioned last week.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/13/full_3d.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this completes the mouse shell design. still need to figure out trigger attachment (more below), though resin printing might make that unnecessary. my initial attachment idea didn&amp;rsquo;t work well.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>tried using small stands and pegs to attach the triggers, but they were too thin (.95mm) and fragile - broke with slight pressure. the holes also came out weird.</p>
<p>to fix this, i decided to increase the thickness of the button part of my triggers while also simultaneously increasing the distance between the stand/hole with the sides.</p>
<h4 id="trigger-problems">trigger problems</h4>
<p>sounds simple - just extrude the face to add thickness, right?</p>
<p>except the upward angle of the triggers caused this mess:

<h6 id="notice-how-as-the-trigger-starts-angling-upwards-a-gap-forms">notice how as the trigger starts angling upwards, a gap forms</h6>
<p>this was a major problem that i wasn&rsquo;t originally sure how to solve, as i wasn&rsquo;t able to print like this, but didn&rsquo;t know what the problem was.</p>
<p>eventually with mr.l&rsquo;s help, i got the trigger&rsquo;s thickness to increase:
utilized an offset plane and projecting both the face and the intercept and connecting the two faces, extruding them to each other.</p>
<p>now the triggers (should) work, just need to add pegs/holes for attachment.</p>

<h4 id="other-problems">other problems</h4>
<p>with the new shell and triggers, i tested the pcb and found some other problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>pcb stability</p>
<p>need to secure the pcb better against the sensor block</p>
<p>current stand design is too loose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trigger length</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t account for sensor block height</p>
<p>solder points prevent full seating</p>
<p>solution(hopefully): extend triggers slightly</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>by solving these two problems and resoldering the original pcb back up, i should be done. i may add a circle thingy(?) for the wires to cleanly flow through.</p>
<p>additionally, i&rsquo;m thinking of stealing a <a href="https://zeromouse.co/products/carbon-scroll?_pos=1&amp;_sid=fd2b3dc77&amp;_ss=r">scroll wheel</a> and resin printing it to put with my mouse (assuming it fits given my dimensions, as it was designed for a different mouse)</p>

            <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;sumobot-updates&#34;&gt;sumobot updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jonas finally worked on the body, only to lose most of the progress (fun). despite this, we managed to mill the pcb and 3d print the main shell, so not much was lost. miles soldered all the components, so now we just need to test everything and do a trial run soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/12/pcb.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one issue is that our sensors might not get fully pressed due to the robot&amp;rsquo;s light weight. this could be problematic since the code depends on complete sensor presses - when released, they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to adjust positioning based on which sensor was activated. hopefully with the battery and the other parts, we won&amp;rsquo;t have this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="zeromouse-updates">zeromouse updates</h3>
<p>fixed my cad file so components are actual parts instead of meshes (not sure why i did that before).</p>
<h4 id="mouse-triggers">mouse triggers</h4>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t happy with how the mouse buttons had those little stand things that required shell modifications for a friction fit. after testing this design, i scrapped it and removed the entire bottom section of the triggers.</p>
<p>however, i&rsquo;d already printed them and discovered the triggers couldn&rsquo;t properly click the pcb buttons because the scroll wheel stand was too long and blocked them.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/12/old_triggers.png">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/12/new_triggers.png">
</div>
<h6 id="old-triggers-vs-new-triggers-left-side-is-old-ones-right-side-is-new-ones">old triggers vs new triggers. (left side is old ones, right side is new ones)</h6>
<p>i redesigned the triggers&rsquo; shape and attachment method (planning to print them as one piece with the shell). the new version has longer but shorter triggers to reduce overall height.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/12/new_triggers_2.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="as-shown-above-the-triggers-no-longer-interfere-with-the-giant-rectangle-thing-scroll-wheel-stand-and-can-actually-click">as shown above, the triggers no longer interfere with the giant rectangle thing (scroll wheel stand) and can actually click.</h6>
<h4 id="shell-v3">shell v3</h4>
<p>kept the same design but lengthened it to fit the new trigger orientation. also enclosed the front completely instead of leaving it open. this allows printing the shell and triggers together, though i might use a different attachment method to avoid supports.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/12/full.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>progress seems slow, but i&rsquo;m happy with how it&rsquo;s coming along. next steps include adding side &ldquo;wings&rdquo; for finger support and deciding whether to print the triggers with supports or find another attachment solution.</p>
<p>i might resin print the final version for better precision and finer details if i like the design enough, including a resin-printed scroll wheel to match as she scroll wheel feels a bit janky.</p>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;zeromouse-updates&#34;&gt;zeromouse updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last week, i mentioned three problems that i had with my first print&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size is really short&amp;hellip; like way shorter than i thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the standoffs for the pcb aren&amp;rsquo;t aligned properly (mainly because i suck at measuring)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the holder for the sensor was a bit small, and there was only one layer of print for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i decided to address these problems and reprint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>last week, i mentioned three problems that i had with my first print</p>
<ol>
<li>the size is really short&hellip; like way shorter than i thought</li>
<li>the standoffs for the pcb aren&rsquo;t aligned properly (mainly because i suck at measuring)</li>
<li>the holder for the sensor was a bit small, and there was only one layer of print for it</li>
</ol>
<p>so i decided to address these problems and reprint.</p>
<h4 id="test-print-two">test print two</h4>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/sensor.jpeg">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/print2.jpeg">
</div>
<p>so i fixed the size issue on my shell, and i&rsquo;m liking it a lot more.</p>
<p>also, i finished the sensor holder, as it holds it perfectly.</p>
<p>however, there are still a few problems on my print, as the standoffs were still slightly missaligned and were too short</p>
<p>i initally didn&rsquo;t think that height would be a problem, but even forcing the pcb to fix in all four standoffs, they pcb would not stay on the shell with the sensor block on the shell. to fix this, i increased the height of the standoffs from 3mm to 5.5mm and reprinted.</p>
<h4 id="test-print-three">test print three</h4>
<p>i decided to downscale the model as i only needed to test the standoff height with the sensor, so i minimized the model as much as possible. additionally, i decreased the distance between the top two standoffs by 0.05mm</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/11/test.jpeg" alt="website">
this ended up being perfect. both the distances between the standoffs and the height of the standoffs worked amazingly with the sensor block inside the shell</p>
<p>going forward, i need to work on the mouse clicks (both left and right buttons)</p>
<h4 id="mouse-buttons">mouse buttons</h4>
<p>so i created a rough model of the mouse buttons, but ended up hating it.</p>
<p>instead, i found a really nice model consisting of mouse buttons, so going forward, i&rsquo;m gonna be recreating my shell to fit with the mouse buttons instead of creating my own mouse buttons.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/old.png">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/new.png">
</div>
<h6 id="left-side-was-my-original-attempt-at-mouse-buttons-right-side-are-the-mouse-buttons-ill-be-using-moving-forward-from-now">left side was my original attempt at mouse buttons. right side are the mouse buttons i&rsquo;ll be using moving forward from now</h6>
<p>due to the stand on the pcb for the scroll wheel, i had to create a hole(?) thing which ended up looking really ugly. additionally, the mouse clicks i made weren&rsquo;t slanted which wouldn&rsquo;t be practical. while it could be adjusted, i hated my original design and was unsure how to fix it.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to try and recreate my shell on this new document, and get both the mouse buttons and shell printed together to test everything and make sure it works.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;slow week since my partner focused more on the rov than our sumobot, so i went back to working on my zeromouse project.&lt;/p&gt;

during our blog post presentations, my friend miles spotted an issue with my button wiring. turns out i was using a faulty button footprint with incorrect wiring. after switching to the right footprint and fixing the connections, the pcb shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any shorts now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>jonas (my partner) also printed the pcb holder for our sumobot, so i&rsquo;ll be milling the board soon.</p>

<p>in my previous blogpost on the zeromouse, there were a bunch of errors that i had to deal with this week</p>

<li>the size is really short&hellip; like way shorter than i thought</li>
<li>the standoffs for the pcb aren&rsquo;t aligned properly (mainly because i suck at measuring)</li>
<li>the holder for the sensor was a bit small, and there was only one layer of print for it</li>
</ol>
<p>i started by resizing and cleaning up the frame design:</p>
<div style="display: flex;">

<p>i also tried a new standoff design since i didn&rsquo;t like the bulky filled lines from before, while hopefully fixing the alignment issues.</p>
<p>the sensor mount isn&rsquo;t added yet, but i&rsquo;m using a thicker shell to avoid the structural problems from last time.</p>

<p>the component placement isn’t ideal, which forced me to rewire parts of the schematic and pcb to make the traces work. because of this, i also had to adjust some pins in my code to account for the changes. i’ll mill the pcb once i have a body to test it with.</p>

besides fixing the pin assignments in my code, i also resolved an issue from last week. previously, the individual sensors wouldn’t work on their own and only functioned when both were activated. my friend miles pointed out that i only needed to read the state of one sensor instead of both.</p>
<p>this fix allowed each sensor to work independently, and now all the fail-safes function correctly—whether one or both sensors are triggered.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/9/backwards.png" alt="website">
last week, i mentioned needing to implement a backward function for the sumobot. i realized that with the current star pattern implementation, the robot would move forward instead of backward. i quickly added a backward function and replaced the forward call with it.</p>
<p>next steps: my friend jonas is working on the body and tires, which i’ll use to test my code and sensors. this will help me identify any errors or adjustments needed before the final assembly.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m sadly doing the project solo, but will be getting some help from my friends to compensate.</p>
<h4 id="idea">idea</h4>
<p>last week, i spent most of my time researching professional sumobot competitions and studying the strategies used by other robots.</p>
<p>since many robots will likely use similar hardware, i decided to focus on a unique design. this gives me an idea of how other robots might operate and allows me to develop strategies to counter them.</p>
<h4 id="motors">motors</h4>
<p>i had two options for plastic motors: 120:1 and 200:1. after some research, i chose the 200:1 motors because they sacrifice speed for more torque. since the robots are lightweight, i think torque will be more important than speed.
<img src="/img/soph/8/motor.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>after soldering one of the motors, i noticed that the other motor was faster, so i soldered another one to balance them out.</p>
<h4 id="sensors">sensors</h4>
<p>initially, i planned to use an irs21b ir sensor, but i decided against it because i didn’t want to deal with calibration. instead, my friends and i opted for roller lever switches. i also heard that some people paint their sumobots white to confuse ir sensors, so this seemed like a better choice.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/8/switch.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>i wrote code to control the sumobot based on three states:</p>
<pre><code>if the left sensor is triggered, it moves right.

if the right sensor is triggered, it moves left.

if both sensors are triggered, it performs a star pattern to avoid being pushed off.
</code></pre>

<h6 id="yes-this-is-a-mess-itll-be-cleaned-later">yes this is a mess. it&rsquo;ll be cleaned later.</h6>
<p>the circuit includes a metromini as the microcontroller, an md17a to control the motors, two motors, two roller lever switches, and two buttons to initialize different start sequences depending on which side of the arena the robot starts on.</p>
<p>i’ll start designing the pcb soon, unless i decide to add more components later (more on that below).</p>
<h4 id="code">code</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/8/directions.png" alt="website">
i created different functions depending on what direction the robot will have to move (left, right, forward, backwards(eventually), and stop).</p>
<p>in addition, i created specific sequences and patterns depending on sensor state and which button is clicked. startL and startR will wait for the enemy sumobot, and attack them when they go forward towards the edge of the arena.

<h4 id="future-plans">future plans?</h4>
<p>i’m considering adding collapsible wings to my sumobot. this would allow it to meet the size requirements while expanding during the match to potentially confuse opponents using front-mounted ir sensors.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/8/wings.gif" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="something-like-this-but-collapsable">something like this, but collapsable.</h6>
<p>furthermore, my code is also broken, where my roller lever sensors when only one is clicked doesn&rsquo;t work. this will be something i have to fix. in addition, i don&rsquo;t know if my code even works, as i haven&rsquo;t made a body or wheels for my sumobot.</p>
<p>we started the sumobot project, where we have to create a &lt;500g robot which will play sumo with other robots.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sadly doing the project solo, but will be getting some help from my friends to compensate.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;we weren’t required to write a blog post before break, so i’m including all the updates from that week here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@optimumtech&#34;&gt;optimum&lt;/a&gt; youtube videos, where he creates a custom mod for the viper v2 pro mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i decided to try something similar with the targus amu660, taking its internals and designing a &amp;ldquo;zerømouse&amp;rdquo;-inspired shell for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3d-model-of-pcb&#34;&gt;3d model of pcb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i began by creating a basic 3d model of the pcb to serve as the foundation for the shell and other components. in the image below, i’ve only modeled the left and right mouse buttons, along with the parts needed for the scroll wheel.

<p>umm&hellip; i blame the 3d printer.
<img src="/img/soph/7/3d.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>this was just a test print, so it’s not a huge deal, but there were some issues.</p>
<p>i printed this on the fusion3, and for some reason, it randomly filled in one side where it wasn’t supposed to.</p>
<p>additionally, i noticed that the sensor area only had one layer, which i’ll need to fix by adjusting the shell thickness. i think that’s the reason behind the problem.</p>
<p>the stands for the pcb mounting holes are also misaligned. this is mostly because i’m not great at using calipers for precise measurements. i’ll need to tweak the hole sizes and reduce the diameter of the cylinders, as they don’t fit into the pcb holes properly.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;i broke another computer. that makes it the fourth thing i’ve broken this year as a sophomore&amp;hellip; at least i managed to complete my lightbox this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of my time was spent 3d printing the enclosure and laser cutting the acrylic piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;acrylic-piece&#34;&gt;acrylic piece&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while the box parts were printing, i continued working on the acrylic design and did a test cut on cardboard to check the fit.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/6/card.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the initial piece was slightly longer than i wanted, so i scaled it down to make it more compact. the adjusted size looked much better.

<p><img src="/img/soph/6/main.jpeg" alt="website">
before the weekend, i started the 3d print for the main housing of my box and when we returned, it turned out amazing, unlike a few other components.</p>
<h4 id="lid">lid</h4>
<p>umm&hellip; i had a few errors with this&hellip;
<img src="/img/soph/6/lid1.jpeg" alt="website">
my first attempt at printing the lid was on the neptune, but it ended up warping. after discussing with others, i learned that many people faced similar issues with warping on that printer. to fix this, i decided to reprint it on the fusion3.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/lid2.jpeg" alt="website">
the second try turned into spaghetti, likely because i didn’t use enough adhesive. this forced me to print the lid a third time&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/lid3.jpeg" alt="website">
finally, after applying too much glue, the lid printed perfectly without any warping or other issues. with this done, only one piece remained before i could assemble the box.</p>
<h4 id="finished-product">finished product</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/6/full.jpeg" alt="website">
with all three prints completed and the acrylic piece finished (cut on the small laser cutter since the larger one was broken), my lightbox is finally done. the temperature sensor isn’t very practical since it’s enclosed, limiting airflow and temperature changes, but it still functions somewhat. the lid fit wasn’t perfect—it required a bit of force to secure—but it eventually worked, and everything came together nicely. moving forward, i have a few vague ideas for projects that i may tackle before we start the sumobot.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;i should be able to finish my lightbox by next week. just a few more tasks left to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;schematic-of-the-board&#34;&gt;schematic of the board&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/5/schem.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.</p>
<h4 id="pcb-errors">pcb errors</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/error_1.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>the image above shows my pcb with several errors. the primary issue was that the traces were too thick, leaving insufficient clearance between components. although i could have enlarged the pcb to resolve these problems, i preferred the compact design and opted to reduce the trace width to 35mils instead of 50mils.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/error_2.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>after addressing those errors, five new ones appeared. these were caused by using the wrong components, as i hadn’t properly managed my electronic library (as mentioned earlier). once i fixed this, all errors were resolved, and the pcb was ready for milling.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/no_errors.png" alt="website"></p>
<h4 id="3d-pcb">3d pcb.</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/3dpcb.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>once the pcb was milled, most of my time was spent crimping the power and ground wires and replacing the neopixel with a lightstrip. i also designed a power mechanism to supply energy to the board. unfortunately, there were no aux connectors available, so adding an aux power option wasn’t possible.</p>
<h4 id="finished-product-pcb">finished product (pcb)</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/finished.jpg" alt="website"></p>
<p>after milling my pcb, i spent most of my time crimping the power and ground wires together, while also swapping the neopixel to a lightstrip. following this, i created a power mechanism in order to power up my board. sadly, there were no aux connectors, so making an aux connector to power my board wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible.</p>
<h4 id="acrylic-piece">acrylic piece</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/piece.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with the pcb complete, the final steps are to 3d print the box and finish the acrylic piece. i’ll start printing the box soon, as i can work on the acrylic piece simultaneously. by the end of next week, everything should be ready for assembly.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;slightly shorter week due to mlk day, so i focused more on double checking everything rather than starting something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design-completed&#34;&gt;box design (completed?)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i first created the lid for my box, which utilizes friction-fit, eliminating the need to use screws to keep the aesthetics clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/4/lid.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;additionally, i designed a separate compartment to house my neopixel. i previously had the component connected with my lid, but that would lead to overhang when printing. by creating it as a new component, i will have to print them separately, and combine them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>additionally, i designed a separate compartment to house my neopixel. i previously had the component connected with my lid, but that would lead to overhang when printing. by creating it as a new component, i will have to print them separately, and combine them together.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/4/np.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>in order to connect the two parts, i plan to use glue. overall, the box looks pretty clean, with no screws and an easy way to fix the box if error&rsquo;s were to occur.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/4/both.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>i believe that at this point, i&rsquo;m done with my lightbox. i will have to check wil mr.l about any potential errors before trying to print out the box. once confirmed, i will move onto creating my acrylic design, which will most likely feature a derpy pokemon design.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/4/full.png" alt="website"> <img src="/img/soph/4/diff_view.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>while finishing the box, a problem occured when making the lid, as the male headers on my pcb were too long and entering in the housing for the neopixel. to counteract this, i decided to scale my design by 0.75 instead of 0.5, leading to a slightly larger box. i&rsquo;m pretty happy with how the model is turning out, as cad isn&rsquo;t my strong suit. there are some things that i don&rsquo;t like, such as having a massive hole for power and not having the fan&rsquo;s on the bottom of the mac mini, as i&rsquo;m not sure how to make it, and not sure if it&rsquo;s possible to print it. to deal with the massive hole, me and my friend miles have discussed potentially using an auxiliary cable for power to make the design more realistic, and remove that massive hole for power.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;finally figured out how all the bugs work, and fixed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another week of the lightbox project, where i spent monday finalizing my code, before working purely on my box design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design&#34;&gt;box design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started this week by restarting my entire box, as i previously didn&amp;rsquo;t have my box cenetered around the origin, and i was building it on the wrong axis. additionally, the dimensions were all messed up, as i was using a wrong scale. upon fixing all my mistakes, i started adding in all of the different type of connection ports on the mac mini. these ports won&amp;rsquo;t have any functionality besides one, which will be used for powering the lightbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>i started this week by restarting my entire box, as i previously didn&rsquo;t have my box cenetered around the origin, and i was building it on the wrong axis. additionally, the dimensions were all messed up, as i was using a wrong scale. upon fixing all my mistakes, i started adding in all of the different type of connection ports on the mac mini. these ports won&rsquo;t have any functionality besides one, which will be used for powering the lightbox.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/3/3d.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>after finishing, i decided to consult my friend jonas for some help with creating standoffs, which will be used to mount my pcb on my box.</p>
<p>on my previous blog posts, i mentioned how i wanted to somehow make the acrylic design as a face of the box. however, there would be lots of problems revolving around orienting the neopixel in the way where it could stay secure, and still be able directly below the acrylic piece. therefore, unless i find a new solution, i will be moving forward from this idea, and use the top face to hold my acrylic piece.</p>
<h4 id="code--bug-fixes">code + bug fixes</h4>
<p>i decided to finally take a close look into my code to figure out some of my bugs, and i found them
<img src="/img/soph/3/code.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>previously, i stated how my temperature sensor was floating, yet worked one time upon changing the led_pin to 10.</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t the problem, but rather me messing things up.</p>
<p>i accidently swapped onewire with the led_pin, causing my neopixel to be connected to my onewire, and my led_pin to be connected to my temperature sensor.</p>
<p>how did the code temporarily work despite them being swapped? no clue.</p>
<p>but eventually, i got it fixed, and was able to troubleshoot my code properly, which ended up working as i expected.</p>
<p>the second bug i fixed was the bug with attiny&rsquo;s randomly not responding.</p>
<p>the problem this time was that since the attiny doesn&rsquo;t have serial support, and software serial wasn&rsquo;t working for me, i kept relying on the metro mini to use the serial, to debug my code. in doing so, i probably ended up corrupting the bootloader of the attiny84&rsquo;s, which caused them to not respond. thankfully, this was an easy, but tedious fix, as i would have to swap both the metro mini and the attiny. fortunately, no permanent was done to either the attiny84, or the metro mini (assuming you don&rsquo;t use both of them together), so they will be able to be reused for future projects.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;new years, same bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2d-model-of-my-pcb&#34;&gt;2d model of my pcb&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/soph/2/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.</p>

<h4 id="2d-model-of-my-pcb">2d model of my pcb</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/2/pcb.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design</p>
<h4 id="schematic-of-the-board">schematic of the board</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/2/schem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with the board design, unless i decide to make new improvements, i&rsquo;m ready to pcb mill upon finishing my lightbox.</p>
<h4 id="box-design">box design</h4>
<p>i decided to try and 3d print my box, using the acrylic piece as a face of my box. originally, i was going to try and make it as compact as possible, but i found more interest trying to 3d model a mac mini design by scratch, and replace the top apple logo with my acrylic piece.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/2/3d_model.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>the box still has lots of work to be done, as i want to try and incorporate all the features of the mac mini, including usb ports, ethernet port, and the bottom fan part. throughout the process of creating this box, i spent time talking with mr.l about overhang, and how to counteract any problems with it.</p>
<h4 id="code-bugs">code bugs</h4>
<p>like last year, the bugs persist.
<img src="/img/soph/2/code.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>like last post, the negative number (-196) shows that the temperature sensor is still floating. it was working the previous days of the week, until when i had to finish up the software of my program. the previous problem was due to my &ldquo;led_pin&rdquo; being set at 9, as even though it was wired up correctly, it caused an issue somehow which lead to the temperature sensor continuously printing -196.</p>
<p>besides that bug, i finalized the code for the lightbox (assuming this works). i decided to use a switch statement which changes the severity of a blue color depending on the temperature in the room, mapped with a range (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80+)</p>
<p>however, more bugs continue, with the attiny84 randomly deciding to not respond, leading to me having to swap out the metro-mini that i&rsquo;m using as the master.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;this week was all about lightbox project, where i had lots of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an attiny85&amp;rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84</p>
<p>orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&rsquo;t have an attiny85&rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.</p>
<p>using the attiny84 was just as frustrating, as the microcontroller stopped working randomly many times, setting me back quite a bit of time</p>
<p>in the end, i got a simple temperature sensor to partially work with my lightbox. (the 18b20 temp sensor im using is having connection issues, which leads to the code running half the time) which will be depicting the color of my box.</p>
