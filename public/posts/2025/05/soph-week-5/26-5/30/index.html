<h3 id="trigger-updates">trigger updates</h3>
<p>if you recall from my previous blog post, the left side of my triggers were pretty messed up as both sides had different geometries.</p>
<p>i tried using a sweep to redo this design, but i figured out that you can&rsquo;t sweep with two rails.</p>
<p>so i asked help from <a href="https://timmy.greenlifestylelabs.com/">tim</a> who suggested that i should loft part of it, then extrude the rest of the sides outwards to get the same size and geometry.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/left_trigger_left.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="left-side-of-mouse-trigger">left side of mouse trigger</h6>
<p>this ended up working perfectly, and fixed the problems with my mouse trigger that i had previously.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/left_trigger_right.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="right-side-of-mouse-trigger">right side of mouse trigger</h6>
<p>in the end, my triggers were almost a one-to-one copy of the original that i took <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/979182-lightweight-zeromouse-inspired-logitech-mx-mouse-m">linked here</a> from this model</p>
<p>after fixing the general shape, i had to create the &ldquo;stand&rdquo; for the mouse to mount onto the shell.
<img src="/img/soph/17/stand.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>had some problems with this one as well, but thanks to tim again, i got the stand to work. this may be adjusted slightly to fit my shell design, but it&rsquo;s looking promising so far.</p>
<h4 id="clicking-mechanism--problems">clicking mechanism + problems</h4>
<p>the final thing i had to do before testing out the print was making a clicking mechanism. had some problems creating the ramp and the clicker? (what do i call this) as it was a curved surface, so i wasn&rsquo;t able to directly make a sketch and extrude outwards.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/pressing.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with all of this done, i can now mirror it to create the right trigger when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>a problem was present however.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/17/problem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>as seen in the image, the scroll wheel stand was too tall for the trigger so i&rsquo;ll have to adjust the clicking thingy&rsquo;s length and the length of the stand so that the trigger doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. additionally, i may have to move the position of the clicker further upwards so the scroll wheel isn&rsquo;t in a weird place again.</p>
