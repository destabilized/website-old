        <p>blog post not required, but i did so much this week that i don&rsquo;t want to merge another week of work into this post.</p>
<p>sumobot competition in four more school days.</p>
<h3 id="massive-code-changes">massive code changes</h3>
<p>wanted to further simplify my code, even though it was already pretty simplified. also added a few things.</p>
<h4 id="directional-movements">directional movements</h4>
<p>previously, my code looked like this.
<img src="/img/soph/8/directions.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>while there is nothing wrong with this, it was quite cluttered with all the digitalwrites, so i decided to simplify it.</p>
<p>using a function to control the motors, i was able to set a value (high or low) to each motor without having to continuously write &ldquo;digitalwrite(motor____, high/low).</p>
<p>in the end, my directional movement code ended up looking like this while utilizing a few functions:</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 90%;" src="/img/soph/16/motor_code.png">
  <img style="width: 55%;" src="/img/soph/16/directions_code.png">
</div>
<h6 id="huge-difference-compared-to-original-code-left-side-is-the-function-right-side-is-passing-the-values-to-the-function-for-each-direction">huge difference compared to original code. left side is the function, right side is passing the values to the function for each direction.</h6>
<p>in addition, i got rid of my old star function and &ldquo;startR&rdquo; function as the right button for some reason didn&rsquo;t work. (probably cause i wired it wrong on my pcb).</p>
<h4 id="button-changes">button changes</h4>
<p>since the right button was always &ldquo;on&rdquo; for some reason, i decided that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary, and just removed it. also, since my code for the buttons was all over the place, i decided to consolidate it into a single function.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/16/button_handling.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="keeping-the-same-idea-and-attack-pattern-of-the-button-but-consolidated">keeping the same idea and attack pattern of the button, but consolidated.</h6>
<h4 id="sensor-changes">sensor changes</h4>
<p>with my old code, when the sensors got activated, the motors moved backwards for a set amount of time. however, it sometimes wouldn&rsquo;t be enough time, and would end up moving forward too early / turning too early.</p>
<p>to fix this, we used a while loop and waited an extra second before starting the turn. in addition, more functions were created to further neaten up the code.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/original_sen.png">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/final_sen_code.png">
</div>
<h6 id="another-comparison-left-is-previous-code-right-side-is-my-updated-code">another comparison. left is previous code, right side is my updated code</h6>
<p>with all of these coding changes, my setup and loop was simplified drastically, now looking like this:
<img src="/img/soph/16/setup+loop.png" alt="website"></p>
<h3 id="testing-shenanigans">testing shenanigans</h3>
<p>we finally decided to get our sumobot assembled and i could finally test my code just to find some problems while testing. we encountered quite a bit of problems that we had to fix.</p>
<p>however, if anyone saw my pcb schematic that i made for the sumobot, you may have noticed that i don&rsquo;t have a common ground.</p>
<h4 id="pcb-problem">pcb problem</h4>
<p>well, we all didn&rsquo;t notice this until we started to test the sumobot where we saw that the sumobot only got power when the lever roller switches weren&rsquo;t pressed down for some reason. despite this, it worked to some degree for some reason (probably using a digital pin on the metromini as ground?)</p>
<p>after some re-looking on the pcb document, we noticed this problem. however, rather than re-milling a pcb, we decided to just make a new trace for ground.
<img src="/img/soph/16/fixed_ground.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>with this fixed, we were able to get testing.</p>
<h4 id="minor-setback">minor setback</h4>
<p>one of the main issues that we wanted to address was the lack of turning by the sumobot. while this was a quick fix of changing the delays to allow the backwards(); function to further back up, i accidentally broke one of the two sumobots.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/broken.jpeg">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/16/broken2.jpeg">
</div>
<p>for some reason, i just forgot to react or protect the bot in case it fell of the table, and it ended up falling off the table.</p>
<p>while this was easily fixed by reprinting the base and re-cutting the acrylic piece, it was a minor setback, and i started testing code on the second sumobot that miles made.</p>
<h4 id="testing-problems-cont">testing problems cont.</h4>
<p>problem no3.</p>
<p>right away, we noticed that one of the major problems was that the robot when crossing the white line (as the lever rollers can&rsquo;t detect color but rather when it isn&rsquo;t pressed), it was unable to bring itself back up.</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/vids/soph/16/problem.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>me and miles spent quite a while debugging possible fixes to this problem, some of which included:
- increasing the amount of times moving backwards off the edge
- implementing a &ldquo;bunnyhop&rdquo; mechanism where it &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, detaching the switches from the edge.
- adding a ramp to the sensors so it wouldn&rsquo;t get caught on the edge.</p>
<p>while the first two mechanisms didn&rsquo;t work, miles eventually noticed that due to the &ldquo;90°&rdquo; angle with the rollers, it wouldn&rsquo;t get back up as it was stuck in a perpendicular angle from the edge and the roller. to fix this, he suggested making a ramp to put onto the sensors to prevent it from getting jammed.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/16/improv.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="cardboard-ramps-to-prevent-jamming-on-the-edge">cardboard ramps to prevent jamming on the edge</h6>
<p>we decided to just use cardboard for a quick fix. combined with some hot glue, this ended up working amazingly.</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/vids/soph/16/fixed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>finally, we wanted to not have a set amount of turning delay, as it led to predictable movements and the sumobot staying on one side of the arena.</p>
<h4 id="turning-fixes--problems">turning fixes + problems</h4>
<p>originally, i was going to use a random function to generate a random number for the delay value, something like this:
<img src="/img/soph/16/turning_idea.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>however, while setting this up in the sumobot i realized that every time the sumobot was run, the same values were showing up.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/16/turning_problems.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="startl-indicates-that-it-has-been-rerun-and-you-can-see-that-the-same-values-show-up">startL indicates that it has been rerun, and you can see that the same values show up.</h6>
<p>this was because i had the seed where the random numbers would come from in the setup, where it would only change if it was re-uploaded. to fix this, i moved it to when the button gets pressed, which led to randomness every time like i wanted.</p>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">  
  <img style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" src="/img/soph/16/turning_fix.png">
  <video style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" controls>
    <source src="/vids/soph/16/turning.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>
<h6 id="random-numbers-this-time-also-used-5-16--100-cause-there-wasnt-much-difference-between-like-600-and-620">random numbers this time. also used (5-16) * 100 cause there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between like 600 and 620</h6>
<p>with all of this, i believe our sumobot is done. potentially gotta fix the problems where it gets stuck for a bit (if possible), but that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<h3 id="sumobot-results">sumobot results</h3>
<p>the orange bot (the one that miles claimed) got second, losing to <a href="https://timmy.greenlifestylelabs.com/">tims</a> and <a href="https://benjismit.wordpress.com/">benji</a> with their extremely fast, suicide bot.</p>
<p>while we are given an extra week to revamp and improve our bots (as a few didn&rsquo;t work as intended), we likely won&rsquo;t be continuing our bot, marking the end of this project&hellip;unless?</p>
