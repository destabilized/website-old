        <p>i should be able to finish my lightbox by next week. just a few more tasks left to complete.</p>
<h4 id="schematic-of-the-board">schematic of the board</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/schem.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.</p>
<h4 id="pcb-errors">pcb errors</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/error_1.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>the image above shows my pcb with several errors. the primary issue was that the traces were too thick, leaving insufficient clearance between components. although i could have enlarged the pcb to resolve these problems, i preferred the compact design and opted to reduce the trace width to 35mils instead of 50mils.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/error_2.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>after addressing those errors, five new ones appeared. these were caused by using the wrong components, as i hadn’t properly managed my electronic library (as mentioned earlier). once i fixed this, all errors were resolved, and the pcb was ready for milling.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/no_errors.png" alt="website"></p>
<h4 id="3d-pcb">3d pcb.</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/3dpcb.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>once the pcb was milled, most of my time was spent crimping the power and ground wires and replacing the neopixel with a lightstrip. i also designed a power mechanism to supply energy to the board. unfortunately, there were no aux connectors available, so adding an aux power option wasn’t possible.</p>
<h4 id="finished-product-pcb">finished product (pcb)</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/finished.jpg" alt="website"></p>
<p>after milling my pcb, i spent most of my time crimping the power and ground wires together, while also swapping the neopixel to a lightstrip. following this, i created a power mechanism in order to power up my board. sadly, there were no aux connectors, so making an aux connector to power my board wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible.</p>
<h4 id="acrylic-piece">acrylic piece</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/5/piece.png" alt="website"></p>
<p>with the pcb complete, the final steps are to 3d print the box and finish the acrylic piece. i’ll start printing the box soon, as i can work on the acrylic piece simultaneously. by the end of next week, everything should be ready for assembly.</p>
