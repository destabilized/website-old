<h3 id="overheating-issue">overheating issue</h3>
<p>while mr. christy was looking in the bios to change the boot priority order, both me and miles noticed that the cpu was idling at 90+ degrees celsius, temperature that it should only reach when under full loads. along with this, there were also numerous errors saying that the cpu was overheating.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/19/overheating.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="the-error-that-we-got-telling-us-that-the-cpu-was-overheating">the error that we got telling us that the cpu was overheating</h6>
<p>as a result, we assumed that the cpu wasn&rsquo;t getting proper cooling, so me and miles decided to open up the computer and looked for the problem. instantly, we noticed that the cpu cooler wasn&rsquo;t making direct contact with the cpu, but just in case, we also decided to repaste the cpu.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/19/inside.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="the-cpu-fan-came-off-way-to-easily-since-it-wasnt-properly-screwed-in">the cpu fan came off way to easily since it wasn&rsquo;t properly &ldquo;screwed&rdquo; in.</h6>
<p>so after some repasting and correctly screwing the fan back in (also why don&rsquo;t intel cooler fans just use screws, that stupid mechanism took so long to work with), the temperatures were looking way better than before.</p>

<h6 id="way-cooler-than-before-60-degrees-cooler-then-before">way cooler than before. 60 degrees cooler then before.</h6>
<h3 id="post-screen">post screen</h3>
<p>mr. christy also mentioned that he wanted to see the post information so he didn&rsquo;t have to guess which key it was to enter the bios, so i enabled that.</p>
<p>however, msi motherboards boot too quickly that you can&rsquo;t read any of the post screen information. even with a delay in the boot time, it wasn&rsquo;t enough to read the information listed.</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/vids/soph/19/post.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>additionally, for some reason having post enabled would also lock the screen resolution to 1024x768, which wasn&rsquo;t ideal. because of this, both mr. christy and i decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth enabling post information.</p>
<h3 id="win-11-installation">win 11 installation</h3>
<p>the windows 11 installation went pretty smoothly, with the only problem being the lack of graphics drivers, so i had to install those.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/19/problems.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>a quick driver installation and this problem was fixed.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/19/fixed.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<h4 id="my-computer-issues">my computer issues</h4>
<p>i originally didn&rsquo;t want to install win11 yet as i wanted to keep my linux partition, but my computer had a few issues.</p>
<p>on thursday, i wanted to get a bit more done on my zeromouse, but when i tried to open fusion, this happened:</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/19/BSOD.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>this would continue happening only on fusion for some reason, but because of this, i decided i was going to reimage my computer after finishing my blog post on linux.</p>
<p>however, when i booted into linux, i had similar problems. the screen would be janky, and it seemed like it wanted to freeze at time. because of this, i decided to cut power and just let the computer sit without power for a bit, and turned it on a bit after. however, when i tried to boot into linux again, i got this message.</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/19/broken.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>my c drive is probably (definitely) corrupted, so i tried installing win11 on it, but it also didn&rsquo;t work (kept saying the image on the usb was corrupted)</p>
<p>so now i&rsquo;m just stuck with a broken computer, and my website is a mess. gotta fix a lot of things</p>
