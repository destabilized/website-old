        <p>birthday + no school monday, so shorter week.</p>
<h3 id="sumobot-updates">sumobot updates</h3>
<p>last week, i mentioned three problems that i had with my first print</p>
<ol>
<li>the size is really short&hellip; like way shorter than i thought</li>
<li>the standoffs for the pcb aren&rsquo;t aligned properly (mainly because i suck at measuring)</li>
<li>the holder for the sensor was a bit small, and there was only one layer of print for it</li>
</ol>
<p>so i decided to address these problems and reprint.</p>
<h4 id="test-print-two">test print two</h4>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/sensor.jpeg">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/print2.jpeg">
</div>
<p>so i fixed the size issue on my shell, and i&rsquo;m liking it a lot more.</p>
<p>also, i finished the sensor holder, as it holds it perfectly.</p>
<p>however, there are still a few problems on my print, as the standoffs were still slightly missaligned and were too short</p>
<p>i initally didn&rsquo;t think that height would be a problem, but even forcing the pcb to fix in all four standoffs, they pcb would not stay on the shell with the sensor block on the shell. to fix this, i increased the height of the standoffs from 3mm to 5.5mm and reprinted.</p>
<h4 id="test-print-three">test print three</h4>
<p>i decided to downscale the model as i only needed to test the standoff height with the sensor, so i minimized the model as much as possible. additionally, i decreased the distance between the top two standoffs by 0.05mm</p>
<p><img src="/img/soph/11/test.jpeg" alt="website">
this ended up being perfect. both the distances between the standoffs and the height of the standoffs worked amazingly with the sensor block inside the shell</p>
<p>going forward, i need to work on the mouse clicks (both left and right buttons)</p>
<h4 id="mouse-buttons">mouse buttons</h4>
<p>so i created a rough model of the mouse buttons, but ended up hating it.</p>
<p>instead, i found a really nice model consisting of mouse buttons, so going forward, i&rsquo;m gonna be recreating my shell to fit with the mouse buttons instead of creating my own mouse buttons.</p>
<div style="display: flex;">  
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/old.png">
  <img style="width: 45%;" src="/img/soph/11/new.png">
</div>
<h6 id="left-side-was-my-original-attempt-at-mouse-buttons-right-side-are-the-mouse-buttons-ill-be-using-moving-forward-from-now">left side was my original attempt at mouse buttons. right side are the mouse buttons i&rsquo;ll be using moving forward from now</h6>
<p>due to the stand on the pcb for the scroll wheel, i had to create a hole(?) thing which ended up looking really ugly. additionally, the mouse clicks i made weren&rsquo;t slanted which wouldn&rsquo;t be practical. while it could be adjusted, i hated my original design and was unsure how to fix it.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to try and recreate my shell on this new document, and get both the mouse buttons and shell printed together to test everything and make sure it works.</p>
