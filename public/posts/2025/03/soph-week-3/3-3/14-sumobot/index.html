        <p>long blog post because we didn&rsquo;t really do much last week, so i&rsquo;m cramming everyhting into this blog post.</p>
<p>we started the sumobot project, where we have to create a &lt;500g robot which will play sumo with other robots.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sadly doing the project solo, but will be getting some help from my friends to compensate.</p>
<h4 id="idea">idea</h4>
<p>i spent most of my time last week learning about professional sumobot competitions, and the strategies that other sumobots use.</p>
<p>furthermore, as many robots will be running with similar hardware, by utilizing a different design, i have a brief idea on how other robots will run, and created strategies to counteract theirs.</p>
<h4 id="motors">motors</h4>
<p>opting for plastic motors like many others gave me two options to pick between. 120:1 and 200:1. after doing some research on each type of motor, i ultimately decided on 200:1. this is because 200:1 sacrafices some speed for more torque, as the robots are so light, i assume torque will be more important than speed.
<img src="/img/soph/8/motor.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>after soldering one of the motors, i realized that another one of my motors was faster than the other, so i decided to solder another motor to deal with this.</p>
<h4 id="sensors">sensors</h4>
<p>originally, i was going to use a irs21b ir sensor, but i got lazy and didn&rsquo;t want to calibrate it, so me and my friends decided to use roller lever switches instead. also, i heard that some people would make their sumobot white to try and throw off the ir sensor&rsquo;s on the robot.
<img src="/img/soph/8/switch.jpeg" alt="website"></p>
<p>i wrote some code to move my sumobot based on three states:
if the left sensor is detected, it&rsquo;ll move right
if the right sensor is detected, it&rsquo;ll move left
and if both sensors are detected it&rsquo;ll do a star pattern to avoid being pushed off.</p>

<h6 id="yes-this-is-a-mess-itll-be-cleaned-later">yes this is a mess. it&rsquo;ll be cleaned later.</h6>
<p>metromini for my microcontroller, md17a to control the motors, two motors, two roller lever switches, and two buttons to initalize two different start sequences depending on which side of the arena it starts in.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be starting to create the pcb soon, unless i add something later (which i will mention further down)</p>
<h4 id="code">code</h4>
<p><img src="/img/soph/8/directions.png" alt="website">
i created different functions depending on what direction the robot will have to move (left, right, forward, backwards(eventually), and stop).</p>
<p>in addition, i created specific sequences and patterns depending on sensor state and which button is clicked. startL and startR will wait for the enemy sumobot, and attack them when they go forward towards the edge of the arena.

<h4 id="future-plans">future plans?</h4>
<p>i want to implement some sort of collapsable wings, so that it fits within the requirements of the sumobot, but can expand wings to potentially throw off anyone who uses an ir sensor at the front.
<img src="/img/soph/8/wings.png" alt="website"></p>
<h6 id="something-like-this-but-collapsable">something like this, but collapsable.</h6>
<p>furthermore, my code is also broken, where my roller lever sensors when only one is clicked doesn&rsquo;t work. this will be something i have to fix. in addition, i don&rsquo;t know if my code even works, as i haven&rsquo;t made a body or wheels for my sumobot.</p>
