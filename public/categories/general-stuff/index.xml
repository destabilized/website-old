      <description>&lt;p&gt;needed a break from my zeromouse project, so i decided to help mr. christy reimage some of the computers with windows 11, as fusion is cutting support for win10. as a result, all the computers needed to be updated to win11 before the end of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;overheating-issue&#34;&gt;overheating issue&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;while mr. christy was looking in the bios to change the boot priority order, both me and miles noticed that the cpu was idling at 90+ degrees celsius, temperature that it should only reach when under full loads. along with this, there were also numerous errors saying that the cpu was overheating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
