      <description>&lt;p&gt;long blog post because we didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much last week, so i&amp;rsquo;m cramming everyhting into this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we started the sumobot project, where we have to create a &amp;lt;500g robot which will play sumo with other robots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i&amp;rsquo;m sadly doing the project solo, but will be getting some help from my friends to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;idea&#34;&gt;idea&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;last week, i spent most of my time researching professional sumobot competitions and studying the strategies used by other robots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we weren’t required to write a blog post before break, so i’m including all the updates from that week here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i got inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@optimumtech&#34;&gt;optimum&lt;/a&gt; youtube videos, where he creates a custom mod for the viper v2 pro mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i decided to try something similar with the targus amu660, taking its internals and designing a &amp;ldquo;zerømouse&amp;rdquo;-inspired shell for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;3d-model-of-pcb&#34;&gt;3d model of pcb&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i began by creating a basic 3d model of the pcb to serve as the foundation for the shell and other components. in the image below, i’ve only modeled the left and right mouse buttons, along with the parts needed for the scroll wheel.&#xA;website&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/7/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i broke another computer. that makes it the fourth thing i’ve broken this year as a sophomore&amp;hellip; at least i managed to complete my lightbox this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;most of my time was spent 3d printing the enclosure and laser cutting the acrylic piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;acrylic-piece&#34;&gt;acrylic piece&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;while the box parts were printing, i continued working on the acrylic design and did a test cut on cardboard to check the fit.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/6/card.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the initial piece was slightly longer than i wanted, so i scaled it down to make it more compact. the adjusted size looked much better.&#xA;website.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/6/acrylic.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i should be able to finish my lightbox by next week. just a few more tasks left to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;schematic-of-the-board&#34;&gt;schematic of the board&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/5/schem.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;while preparing to mill my pcb, mr. christy suggested that using power and ground symbols would help clean up my schematic. i also ran into some issues during the milling process because i used incorrect components, as i hadn’t taken the time to set up an electronic library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;slightly shorter week due to mlk day, so i focused more on double checking everything rather than starting something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design-completed&#34;&gt;box design (completed?)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i first created the lid for my box, which utilizes friction-fit, eliminating the need to use screws to keep the aesthetics clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/4/lid.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;additionally, i designed a separate compartment to house my neopixel. i previously had the component connected with my lid, but that would lead to overhang when printing. by creating it as a new component, i will have to print them separately, and combine them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;finally figured out how all the bugs work, and fixed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;another week of the lightbox project, where i spent monday finalizing my code, before working purely on my box design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design&#34;&gt;box design&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i started this week by restarting my entire box, as i previously didn&amp;rsquo;t have my box cenetered around the origin, and i was building it on the wrong axis. additionally, the dimensions were all messed up, as i was using a wrong scale. upon fixing all my mistakes, i started adding in all of the different type of connection ports on the mac mini. these ports won&amp;rsquo;t have any functionality besides one, which will be used for powering the lightbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;new years, same bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;2d-model-of-my-pcb&#34;&gt;2d model of my pcb&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/2/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this week was all about lightbox project, where i had lots of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an attiny85&amp;rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
