      <description>&lt;p&gt;slightly shorter week due to mlk day, so i focused more on double checking everything rather than starting something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design-completed&#34;&gt;box design (completed?)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i first created the lid for my box, which utilizes friction-fit, eliminating the need to use screws to keep the aesthetics clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/sw4/lid.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;additionally, i designed a separate compartment to house my neopixel. i previously had the component connected with my lid, but that would lead to overhang when printing. by creating it as a new component, i will have to print them separately, and combine them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;finally figured out how all the bugs work, and fixed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;another week of the lightbox project, where i spent monday finalizing my code, before working purely on my box design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;box-design&#34;&gt;box design&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i started this week by restarting my entire box, as i previously didn&amp;rsquo;t have my box cenetered around the origin, and i was building it on the wrong axis. additionally, the dimensions were all messed up, as i was using a wrong scale. upon fixing all my mistakes, i started adding in all of the different type of connection ports on the mac mini. these ports won&amp;rsquo;t have any functionality besides one, which will be used for powering the lightbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;new years, same bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;2d-model-of-my-pcb&#34;&gt;2d model of my pcb&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andrewhuang.vercel.app/img/soph/sw2/pcb.png&#34; alt=&#34;website&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this week was all about lightbox project, where i had lots of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;generally with the lightbox, you use an atmega328p, but i decided to create as small of a lightbox as possible, and ended up using an attiny84&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;orignally, i was planning to use an attiny25, as the shop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an attiny85&amp;rsquo;s, but the problem is that despite using lightweight libraries to allow the attiny25 to run the code, it just cannot handle the neopixel, and leads to plenty of errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
