new years, same bugs. 

due to the new years, i decided to just incorperate the 2 days we had on the 2nd, and the 3rd to this post.

i started this week by focusing on the pcb design for my lightbox, and got guidance from my friend miles on how to create the pcb. 

#### 2d model of my pcb

shown above is the 2d model of my pcb, where i tried to make it as compact as possible, in the effort to create as small of a board as possible. i may redesign the board to use a type-c connector for power to better fit my design

#### schematic of the board

with the board design, unless i decide to make new improvements, i'm ready to pcb mill upon finishing my lightbox. 

#### box design
i decided to try and 3d print my box, using the acrylic piece as a face of my box. originally, i was going to try and make it as compact as possible, but i found more interest trying to 3d model a mac mini design by scratch, and replace the top apple logo with my acrylic piece.

the box still has lots of work to be done, as i want to try and incorporate all the features of the mac mini, including usb ports, ethernet port, and the bottom fan part. throughout the process of creating this box, i spent time talking with mr.l about overhang, and how to counteract any problems with it. 

#### code bugs
like last year, the bugs persist.

like last post, the negative number (-196) shows that the temperature sensor is still floating. it was working the previous days of the week, until when i had to finish up the software of my program. the previous problem was due to my "led_pin" being set at 9, as even though it was wired up correctly, it caused an issue somehow which lead to the temperature sensor continuously printing -196. 

besides that bug, i finalized the code for the lightbox (assuming this works). i decided to use a switch statement which changes the severity of a blue color depending on the temperature in the room, mapped with a range (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80+)

however, more bugs continue, with the attiny84 randomly deciding to not respond, leading to me having to swap out the metro-mini that i'm using as the master.
