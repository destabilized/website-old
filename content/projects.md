## [deep reinforcement ai](https://github.com/siwence/inqui)
#### 2024-present

inspired by ai warehouse, i decided to try and create my own deep reinforcement learning ai from scratch.

using an environment made using pybullet and gymnasium, i created a simple obstacle course where the ai has one objective: reaching the pressure plate. by using a dqn (deep q-network) it and a reward system, it's movements will become seemingly random, before quickly adapting to reach the pressure plate. 

through this project, i learn the basics of deep reinforcement ai learning, and dip my toes in [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/), [pybullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/), and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).(it's currently broken cause i suck lol)
