i am currently a sophomore attending medford vocational technical high school in the robotics and engineering shop. i am in the graduating class of 2027, with an interest in programming and electronics. 

i code in python and arduino, but open to learn new programming languages. additionally, i have some expertise in machining and cad, but i'm not as proficient in those fields.
